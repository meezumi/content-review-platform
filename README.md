# Collaborative Content Review and Approval Platform

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the content review and approval process for teams. It provides a centralized platform where users can upload documents, images, and videos, and stakeholders can provide feedback through real-time comments and formal approvals. The goal of this project is to eliminate the confusion of email chains and fragmented feedback, creating a single source of truth for creative and marketing workflows.

This project serves as a powerful portfolio piece, demonstrating expertise in full-stack development, real-time technologies, and building applications that solve tangible business problems.

### Real-World Use Case

In many organizations, the process for reviewing and approving content (like marketing materials, design mockups, or legal documents) is inefficient. Feedback is often scattered across lengthy email threads, Slack messages, and multiple file versions, leading to confusion, missed feedback, and delays.

This platform solves this by providing:
*   A **centralized hub** for all content under review.
*   **Real-time commenting**, allowing for interactive feedback sessions.
*   **Version control** to track changes and revisions.
*   **Structured approval workflows** to ensure the right people sign off in the right order.
